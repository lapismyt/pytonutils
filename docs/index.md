**Tonutils** is a high-level, object-oriented Python library designed to simplify interaction with the TON blockchain. It integrates several major services and tools, including:

!!! tip
    For a better understanding of TON internal architecture and core principles, we also recommend reviewing the [official TON documentation](https://docs.ton.org).

**RPC APIs**

  * [tonapi.io](https://tonapi.io) — REST API for accessing TON blockchain data.
  * [toncenter.com](https://toncenter.com) — fast and reliable HTTP API for The Open Network.
  * [quicknode.com](https://www.quicknode.com/) — low-latency global infrastructure for HTTP access to TON.
  * [tatum.io](https://tatum.io) — RPCs and APIs for Web3 projects: fast, reliable, affordable.

**Native ADNL**

  * [pytoniq](https://github.com/yungwine/pytoniq) — library for direct interaction with TON Lite servers.

Tonutils combines these capabilities into a powerful and flexible toolkit for developers, making it easier to build applications on top of the TON ecosystem.

!!! tip
    To retrieve blockchain data — such as transaction lists, NFT lists, counts, and similar details — it is **strongly recommended** to use indexer APIs like [Toncenter](https://toncenter.com/), [Tonapi](https://tonapi.io), and similar services. For working specifically with Tonapi, you can also use my Python library [pytonapi](https://github.com/nessshon/pytonapi).
